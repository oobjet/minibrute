# minibrute

norns_minibrute is a collection of utility app to control the minibrute synthesizer from the norns platform.
Those apps can reconfigure the minibrute and generate a midi clock from a pulse audio signal to sync the minibrute to analog devices with no midi output.

## TODO

- an app to convert audio input to midi notes output (to mimic MS-20 external input).
- an app to change parameters via midi CCS (see minibrute connection manual for details).
